    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      A judicious amount of heavy cream enriches this simple tomato sauce, 
      producing a lush texture that clings to the pasta without blanketing richness. 
      Crushing the canned tomatoes by hand creates a rustic mixture of tomato pulp, 
      pieces, and puree.

    <p>
      When your pasta reaches al dente and it's time to drain it, 
      you'll want to reserve a small amount of the cooking liquid 
      for the sauce. The starches in it serve as a thickening agent, 
      helping to emulsify the sauce and aid in its ability to coat each 
      piece of pasta. It also works wonders to revive your leftovers â€” 
      splash in a bit of the water as you reheat your meal to restore texture.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>

      <li>Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</li>
