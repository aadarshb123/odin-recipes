    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Generous portions of this pasta dish perfectly showcase the white truffleâ€™s 
      heady aroma. Use this tagliolini recipe, or purchase fresh spaghetti. Now is 
      the time to break out a great bottle of wine to balance the creaminess of the 
      dish with acid.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound fresh tagliolini or spaghetti</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup best-quality butter (4 ounces), divided</li>
      <li>2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (about  1/2 cup)</li>
      <li>1 ounce fresh Alba truffle, shaved</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high. 
        Season lightly with salt. Add pasta, and stir gently with tongs. 
        Boil until pasta is cooked but still slightly chewy, about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        While pasta cooks, melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over high. 
        Using tongs, transfer cooked pasta to skillet, and stir to evenly 
        coat with butter. Use a ladle to add about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid 
        to skillet, and continue stirring rapidly. Add remaining 1/4 cup butter,
        and shake and stir pan until the simmering water reduces slightly and 
        forms a creamy sauce that clings to the pasta. Remove from heat, sprinkle
        pasta with cheese, and continue stirring until pasta partially absorbs 
        cooking liquid and forms a creamy sauce. If pasta looks dry, add a splash 
        more cooking liquid. Divide pasta among 4 bowls, and top with shaved truffles. Serve immediately.
