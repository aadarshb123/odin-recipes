    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make this restaurant-level Fettuccine Alfredo at home for 
      an unforgettable meal. We start by cooking the pasta 
      until it is almost but not totally cooked. 
      Then, use the starchy pasta cooking water as the base for 
      the creamy sauce, slowly whisking in pieces of cold butter to 
      emulsify the sauce. Then when you return the pasta to the sauce 
      and simmer everything together, the flavor of the sauce infuses the 
      pasta with its richness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the pasta cooking water is salted and the Parmesan cheese is 
      inherently salty, you don’t need to add much if any additional salt 
      to the sauce; be sure to taste it before seasoning further. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A mixture of crispy panko, parsley, and Parmesan takes this pasta over the 
      top, adding depth of flavor and a lovely crunch to the dish. You’ll want to 
      serve this pasta immediately after finishing the pasta in the sauce, and savor 
      each creamy, garlicky, cheesy bite.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound uncooked fettuccine</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup inely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>4 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated with a Microplane grater (about 2 1/2 cups), divided</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (6 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
      <li>Flaky salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add pasta, 
        and cook according to package directions to just barely al dente. Using 
        tongs, transfer pasta to a colander, and drain, reserving 3 1/2 cups pasta 
        cooking water. Return pasta to warm pot; drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 
        and gently stir with tongs to coat. Set aside.</li>
      <li>While pasta cooks, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over 
        medium until glossy and lighter in color. Add garlic; cook, stirring constantly,
        until fragrant and golden brown, 20 to 30 seconds. Add panko; cook, stirring 
        constantly, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl;
        add kosher salt, and stir to combine. Let cool to room temperature, about 5 
        minutes. Wipe skillet clean. Add parsley and 1/4 cup of the cheese to panko 
        mixture; stir to combine, and set aside.</li>
      <li>Add 3 cups of the reserved cooking water to cleaned large skillet; bring to 
        a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium-low. Gradually add butter to 
        skillet, whisking constantly and letting each butter cube melt before the next 
        addition, until butter has emulsified into liquid, 10 to 12 minutes. (Mixture 
        should be at least 180°F, uniformly creamy in color, and starting to bubble if 
        left undisturbed.)</li>
      <li>
        Add pasta to butter sauce in skillet; toss to evenly coat. Cook over medium, 
        stirring constantly, until sauce comes to a boil (you will see bubbles in liquid 
        in center of skillet), 3 to 5 minutes. . Sprinkle with 1 cup of the cheese; toss 
        and stir to evenly coat pasta in cheese and sauce. Add remaining 1 1/4 cups cheese,
        and cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until pasta is evenly coated in sauce,
        about 2 minutes. If more liquid is needed for sauce, gradually add additional 
        reserved cooking water 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring and tossing to coat. 
        Remove from heat. Season to taste with kosher salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide pasta evenly among plates. Top each with 1 tablespoon toasted panko mixture.
        Garnish with flaky salt and additional parsley. Serve immediately.
